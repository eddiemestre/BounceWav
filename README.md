# BounceWav

BounceWav turns your smartphone into an instrument allowing you to trigger and sculpt sounds by accessing the gyroscope and accelerometer.

This project was built during Hack Music LA, the LA Philharmonic's first Hackathon in October 2017.

The project won the LA Phil Prize, along with a cash reward of $2500.
